  "body": "<pre><code>At 0310 hours eastern standard time North American Aerospace Defense Command detected an object of indeterminate mass entering the atmosphere over the eastern seaboard.\nAll personnel who have attempted to observe this object directly or indirectly have been reported as entering a catatonic state, shortly followed by exsanguination through unknown means.\nAt 0328 an unmanned reconnaissance aircraft approached the unknown object. Immediately after entering audible range the objects radar signature scattered and all contact with the aircraft was lost.\nFurther analysis has shown that the object separated into a cloud of indeterminate size and a small part of its mass surrounded the aircraft briefly.\nAnimals in controlled observation environments on the east coast have been seen to be housing in burrows or laying on the ground with their eyes tightly closed.\nThe cloud of objects is now spreading at low altitude over the entire North American Continent.\nFor your own safety, we repeat:\nDo not look outside.\nDo not look at the sky.\nDo not make noise.\nKeep close watch on your devices for further updates as audio warnings have been discontinued.\n</code></pre>"
