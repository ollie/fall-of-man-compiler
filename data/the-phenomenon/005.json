  "body": "<p>Millie has fallen into a routine.</p>\n\n<p>She wakes up at 6:30am, and goes fishing.</p>\n\n<p>After setting her catches on her cooking rock, she turns the lamps to high and feeds the rest of the animals under her care.</p>\n\n<p>She knows it&#39;s been 4 days since the first alert. She has no idea when the generators will run out of fuel.</p>\n\n<p>The lizards need warmth and insects, the fish need their bubblers, filters, and fishfood, the fridges, lights, air conditioners, and the phone need power…</p>\n\n<p>Millie knows her situation is unique. Most people caught away from home are probably in nice grocery stores or with strangers, not alone in a zoo, but she&#39;s just thankful the reptile house and the aquarium are in the same windowless building. She knows all the equipment and animals make noise, and the building is definitely putting out too much heat, but she doesn&#39;t know where any of the controls are, or how to work them. They might as well be on Mars.</p>\n\n<p>She&#39;s thankful, she&#39;s got food, water, entertainment, and things to keep her busy.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s the damn noise that bothers her.</p>\n\n<p>All hours of the day and night. Chittering, skittering scratches on the walls and roof, at the heavy wooden doors.</p>\n\n<p>She wonders how long until they break through…</p>"
