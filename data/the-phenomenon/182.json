Are you ok?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Watkins looked to Kellogg and the giant that escorted them in before replying.</p>\n\n<p><em>Better than ok Sir.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>How do you mean?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Kellogg decided to speak up then.</p>\n\n<p><em>Well Sir, uhh.. That&#39;s rather complicated.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Is it something you&#39;d prefer to keep, uh, in-house?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Sir?</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Something you&#39;d rather keep away from prying, uh..</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Longmire noticed the giants lacked anything resembling a terrestrial ear.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>..listeners?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Looks of dawning understanding came through on Kellogg and Watkins faces, and Watkins answered.</p>\n\n<p><em>Oh no Sir! They&#39;re.. They&#39;re our friends! Allies!</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Just how the fuck did you come that conclusion?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>That&#39;s a long story Sir.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think we have the time for a condensed version.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Sir it&#39;s complicated..</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Spill it Sailor!</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Watkins and Kellogg frowned simultaneously. Kellogg responded.</p>\n\n<p><em>Well Sir, they brought us back.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>You mean they guided you back to the <em>Oregon</em>, back in New York? That you didn&#39;t stumble on us by pure luck?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>No, Sir, that&#39;s not what I meant.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Then what <em>do</em> you mean!?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Well you see, one of them, well, kind of one of them but not really, anyway, something like them killed us.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>...</p>\n\n<p>..Watkins what the fuck is he talking about? </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Watkins shifted his weight from one foot to the other before he spoke.</p>\n\n<p><em>It&#39;s true Sir. A giant, like them, kind of.. well it ripped us apart. I know it hurt, I remember knowing it hurt, but, I can&#39;t quite seem to remember the pain of it. Nor the feeling of being dead.. &#39;cept I just</em> <strong><em>knew</em></strong> <em>I was dead.. Sir.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>..and then, because of them, now you&#39;re not, is that what you&#39;re telling me?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Yes Sir.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ok. Let&#39;s just say,  for the sake of argument, that you&#39;re 100% correct. How in the hell do you expect me not to see you as compromised? As biased?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>We knew you&#39;d think that, but, we had to tell you,  they&#39;re not all alike.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Are some more talkative?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>No Sir, what we&#39;re saying is, just because they look alike, are the same sorts of beings, don&#39;t mean they&#39;re all on the same side Sir.</em></p>"
