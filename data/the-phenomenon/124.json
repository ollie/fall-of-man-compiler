  "body": "<p><em>The Phenomenon, Day 93, Buenos Aires</em></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>A Gigalo.</em></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yeah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Are you fucking kidding me?</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I realize that&#39;s probably not the answer you expected or hoped for…</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Granted.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>…but I&#39;m betting it&#39;s not the answer you feared either…</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Not really.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>…so I&#39;m hoping that there exists a chance for a more casual conversation…</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Uh-huh.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>…perhaps even something, uh, sans shotgun…?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The barrel briefly pressed harder into his throat.</p>\n\n<p><em>Not likely.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>O-O-Ok… Now… Uh… I see I&#39;m gonna have to make the first trusting move…</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>What are you proposing?</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I stand up, you can pull my pistols out of my waistband. They&#39;re the only weapons I have. After that, you can take a step or two back where the barrel isn&#39;t pressing so pointedly and directly against my throat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>That sounds like a good idea…</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Good idea?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>…yeah a good idea.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ok.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>…so stand up.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Right! Right… Ok.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Slowly, Viktor leaned forward, ever concious of the pressure of the scattergun at his Adams Apple. As he put pressure on the balls of his feet to stand, he felt the eyes of the man briefly flick down to his feet.</p>\n\n<p>He let the opportunity pass and continued his slow rise to standing. As he reached his full height the smaller man had to shuffle a half step closer and raise the shotgun to maintain the pressure on his neck.</p>\n\n<p>He shifted his grip slightly on the stock before releasing the pump handle to reach forward and grab the Lugers from Viktor&#39;s waistband one at a time, throwing them both on the floor behind him.</p>\n\n<p>Viktor remained standing with his hands on his head, calm and unreadable as sweat poured from the smaller man in buckets.</p>\n\n<p><em>Ok… So… Now what?</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think the next step was you take that pump action a more comfortable distance from my neck.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Hmm… I don&#39;t think so.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>That&#39;s not exactly confidence building.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>I imagine not… But now I&#39;ve got all the advantages.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Right. So what do you say is next?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>I think you&#39;re going to sit back down and tell me why you&#39;re here.</em></p>\n\n<p>Viktor eased himself back down into the office chair just as slowly as he&#39;d stood.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>And if my answers continue to be unexpected and nonthreatening?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Then you die quick and merciful.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>…And I&#39;ll bet if they&#39;re exactly what you expect or threatening I die slow, is that it?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>You seem to grasp the concept.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Not much incentive to cooperate then if I die either way.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>You avoid a lot of pain and suffering.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Only if I&#39;m not what you expect, not threatening, and honest at that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>True.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>You&#39;re going to be disappointed.</p>\n</blockquote>"
