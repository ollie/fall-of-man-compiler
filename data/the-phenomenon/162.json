  "body": "<p><em>The Phenomenon, Day 94, Chicago Art Institute</em></p>\n\n<p><em>..whoever said I was?</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>~</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>So.. Let me get this straight.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Ok.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>You&#39;re working for the Project.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Yes.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>And the Japanese <em>think</em> you&#39;re working for them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Yes.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>But the Japanese also <em>know</em> you&#39;re working for the Project.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Yes.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>So you actively chose an assignment that would seemingly work against the Project.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Yes.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Because you believe that actually accomplishing the assignment will convince the Japanese you&#39;ve abandoned the Project in favor of them?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>No, I&#39;m quite sure it won&#39;t.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Then why do you actually want me to let you copy the database and turn it over to them?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>I can&#39;t tell you that.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Can&#39;t or won&#39;t?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Both, bizarrely enough.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don&#39;t like half answers, I don&#39;t like wise-asses, and I expect cooperation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>This goes above your paygrade.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mr. Reitmeyer.. I&#39;m the current head of the Project. The President you know died in the initial event, so did the Vice President. The Speaker of the House was sworn in and he died when Air Force One bought it. After that there&#39;s nobody in the Chain of Command above me. In this situation, I <strong><em>am</em></strong> the highest paygrade, so talk.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>All due respect, but operational control isn&#39;t the same as actually being or having the authority you&#39;d need.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>..Fine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Lt. McGuire whistled three short notes and two of his men materialized from the shadows behind them, fully armed once more.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Gentlemen..</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Zoe found her voice once more to protest.</p>\n\n<p><em>Hold on, you said..!</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Quiet! Gentlemen I want Mr. Reitmeyer bound, gagged, and strapped into the Chopper as soon as possible. We&#39;ll continue this debriefing at the Facility.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>You agreed to disarm while here!</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>..And I did. You can get mad at the men if you&#39;d like.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Zoe opened her mouth to complain further but a glance at the armed men now roughly manhandling Viktor into a set of plastic zip cuffs made her reconsider.</p>"
