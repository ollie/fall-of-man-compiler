She was actually a little bit of an oddity. She was undertow after being decommissioned and broke free in international waters. The cost of finding and recovering her would&#39;ve been more than the proceeds of her scrap so she was left to drift, unmanned and unguided.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>So she&#39;s a derelict?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Has been for years, now she&#39;s bow to sky with.. Looks like her port anchor caught on one of the Globe&#39;s amidships cargo cranes.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>So she&#39;s already stripped of any useful gear?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Guaranteed Captain.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Then ignore her. Find your way aboard the <em>Disney Magic</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>There was a boarding hatch on her Port Bow we saw on her first way round, looked like it had a recessed access handle.. We&#39;ll make it around that way.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Good. Get back to me with any further observations..</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>I have one already sir.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Go ahead then.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>The Starboard Bow Cargo access on the Globe is hanging open, ramp extended down into the water. If needs be we could board her no problem.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>How many radios do you have with you?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Six, one for each of us.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Alright, well, first priority is still the <em>Magic</em>, continue headed around and board her, her survivors and communications suite are the only reason we&#39;ve bothered stopping.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Aye sir.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>~</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Sir we&#39;re coming around the bow of the</em> <strong><em>Globe</em></strong> <em>to the stern of the</em> <strong><em>Magic</em></strong> <em>now.. I&#39;m seeing a couple of lifeboat davits extended from the port side of the</em> <strong><em>Magic..</em></strong> <em>Sir! The port side amidships loading ramp of the</em> <strong><em>Globe</em></strong> <em>is extended directly onto the</em> <strong><em>Magic</em></strong> <em>through some windows on the.. Looks like the third or fourth deck.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Is that how they&#39;ve gotten stuck together?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>No sir.. I&#39;m also seeing two, no, three of the</em> <strong><em>Globe&#39;s</em></strong> <em>cargo cranes hooked onto the</em> <strong><em>Magic</em></strong> <em>at different points.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Intentional?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Looks that way sir.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Interesting.. Anything else?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>No sir.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Very well, proceed to that entry hatch you spotted.</p>\n</blockquote>"
