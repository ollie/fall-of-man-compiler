  "body": "<p>The snow did little to comfort her now. When she was a little girl, snow had always seemed magical. Christmastime, sledding, and snowball fights… Fresh baked cookies and Hot Chocolate…</p>\n\n<p>Now the swirling blizzard outside was nothing but cold. Alien shapes moved in the darkness just beyond her vision, trees, perhaps, maybe elk. She&#39;d seen elk moving outside before, keeping their heads down and their eyes low, moving slowly, one hoof at a time… It was probably elk. Hopefully.</p>\n\n<p>She shouldn&#39;t even have been looking outside, she knew, but she&#39;d hoped, prayed even, that the snow would bring her some kind of respite from the loneliness, some shred of happiness.</p>\n\n<p>But there was none. Just howling wind, snow, and darkness beyond the glow of her flashlight. As she turned to go back into the depths of the store, she heard them impact the glass behind her. She squeezed her eyes shut. They&#39;d occasionally wrapped the building before. She knew what to do. As she began walking, she heard them start their infernal noise. She knew she was safe, but she still quickened her pace. Suddenly the sound of shattering glass and the feel of a cold and biting wind struck her from behind. <em>They would get inside!</em></p>\n\n<p>She knew better than to look. She ran. She could hear something giving chase, something big.</p>"
