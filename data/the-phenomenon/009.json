  "body": "<p>Sharon took hold of the handle to the hatch firmly in her right hand, her left, her dominant hand, tightly gripping the .45 she&#39;d gotten from her first bug out bag, she readied herself to spring the hatch open and dive into the tunnel above, ready to roll, take aim, and fire if she had to.</p>\n\n<p>With a silent count to three, she turned the handle and launched her entire body weight against the hatch and to the right, onto the ground, she heard a startled gasp and as she rolled into a crouching firing position, both hands on her weapon, her eyes down the barrel, lining up the iron sights… On a little girl. No more than 10. Dirty, starving. In what once must have been a frilly yellow nightgown. She clutched a dead flashlight in her hands, tears in her eyes as she gasped and shook with fear.</p>\n\n<p>As quickly as she&#39;d snapped on target she disengaged, putting the weapon on safe and holstering it as she stood, putting her hands up.\n&quot;I&#39;m not going to hurt you honey, I thought you might&#39;ve been…&quot;</p>\n\n<p>And then with a flash of white light and sudden pain on the back of the head, her world went dark.</p>"
