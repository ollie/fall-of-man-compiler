  "body": "<p><em>The Phenomenon, Day 90, NE New York City</em></p>\n\n<p>Captain Longmire leaned back on the stool behind the counter of the bodega, his thick navy issue parka insulating his shoulder from the chill of the wall behind him.</p>\n\n<p>His Master At Arms, Cox, stood against the far wall, it was reinforced glass, but it was plastered over with adverts long ago…</p>\n\n<p>The remaining members of the shore party had taken up on the second floor, better view of the river, the zodiac, and the Oregon.</p>\n\n<p>Their momentary reverie was ended by the sound of distant gunfire. Longmire and Cox were on the radio in seconds calling the Oregon and the retrieval party on the radios. The Oregon confirmed no shots fired aboard, the retrieval party answering only in static.</p>\n\n<p>Just as Longmire was about to order Cox to prepare to move out, a flash of light from the stairwell told him his observers had something to report.</p>\n\n<p>Climbing the stairs two at a time, he came out in the nursery that had the observers and their post. Without a word they indicated he look for himself.</p>\n\n<p>Looking through the IR scope they&#39;d set up in a window gap, he looked down on the East River. Walking along the Oregon was a solitary figure, easily twice again as tall as a man. As it walked the IR scope registered everything around it drop in temperature, quickly and severely.</p>\n\n<p>His curiosity and his gut lurched at the consequences of what he was seeing, even so, he knew he had other priorities, his men unaccounted for, the English VIP they were supposed to be fetching…</p>\n\n<p>Things were getting complicated, fast.</p>"
