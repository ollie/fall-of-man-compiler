  "body": "<p><em>The Phenomenon, Day 93, Center for Disease Control Garage, Atlanta</em></p>\n\n<p>Linda looked at the ever more confusing Jesse with a look of pure bewilderment.</p>\n\n<p><em>Well of course, doesn&#39;t everybody?</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I mean lately, have you dreamt lately?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>More like nightmares.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Heh-heh… That&#39;s right they would be… Can&#39;t blame ya… But what kind?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Does it matter?</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It might. Doc Rafei there… He said something that sounded a bit crazy there at the end-</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Well he did have a traumatic brain injury…</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>-I get that, I do, but… That bit about &quot;formless gods&quot; struck me as familiar. &#39;Cause y&#39;see lately I&#39;ve been having these dreams.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>…dreams about alien beings without distinct shape…</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>…impossible forms, voices echoing in a void, beckoning, entreating…</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>…a heavy sense of threat and impending horrific doom?</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yeah… Yeah!</p>\n\n<p>…</p>\n\n<p>…wait a minute…</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>This is incredibly surreal…</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>That&#39;s one way to put it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Normally I don&#39;t remember my dreams at all but lately these have been…</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>…vivid. Like you <em>can&#39;t</em> forget&#39;em.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Yeah… Wait… Do you think this means something?</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Well hell yes I think it means something!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Well I mean I&#39;m certain there&#39;s a reasonable explanation for it.</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>What do you mean?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Well I mean human psychology is a science… Science depends on repeatable results. Statistics… Maybe there&#39;s something about this situation, the psychology of the apocalypse, of desperation and isolation, something that works to cause similar patterns of dreams…</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ain&#39;t that overlooking the obvious?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>What? Something supernatural?</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Well we&#39;re sitting in a truck cocooned in flying death that&#39;s invisible in infrared or ultraviolet, half froze because of some wicked magical giants that sing EMPs into existence… Supernatural ain&#39;t exactly far fetched no more.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>…</em></p>\n\n<p><em>…what giants?</em></p>"
