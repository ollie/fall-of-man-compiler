  "body": "<p>The light from my cell killed my eyes. This early in the morning what could be so goddamned important?</p>\n\n<p>As I read the emergency alert with one eye I rubbed the sleep out of the other.</p>\n\n<p>Then I sat up and read it again with both.</p>\n\n<p>And again.</p>\n\n<p>This has got to be some kind of joke.</p>\n\n<p>I rolled over and threw my legs off the side of the bed, working them into my slippers.</p>\n\n<p>I stretched and stood up, weakness wobbling my gait as I took a few steps towards the windows. I felt my heavy drapes resist parting, almost as if they knew what would happen.</p>\n\n<p>As I peeked out down the street, I didn&#39;t see anything unusual at first, then I remembered, the sky.</p>\n\n<p>I turned my gaze upwards to the sickly orange glow of the cities light pollution splayed across the clouds, and that&#39;s where I saw them. Small, black, jagged, like pieces of shattered onyx flocking through the sky, no wings, no sounds, countless shards of ebony wheeling and flitting to and fro in a chaotic scramble.</p>\n\n<p>And then I stopped breathing. My hands let go of the drapes, my legs fell out from under me. Layed down on my carpet, I couldn&#39;t move, couldn&#39;t breathe.. Oh God, why did I look?</p>"
