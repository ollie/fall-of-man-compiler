  "body": "<p>Sharon was wandering in the dark. Echoes of images and horrors from the past emerging and then disappearing again along the edges of her consciousness.</p>\n\n<p>Her fathers fat fingers and leering smile.</p>\n\n<p>The moonlight glinting off the knife that first time she was stabbed in the alleyway she called home when she was 14.</p>\n\n<p>The feel of terror, humilation, and pain as the gang from the group home &quot;claimed&quot; her when she was 17…</p>\n\n<p>The flash from a mortar explosion in that god-forsaken desert when she was 22…</p>\n\n<p>But somewhere… elsewhere, distant… Like drums, or a heartbeat… </p>\n\n<p>An echo… Thoughts… Not her own… The same voice that had been trying to get in for weeks, ever since… No. That was just coincidence… <em>Obey…</em> Resist! <em>Surrender…</em> Fight! <em>Despair…</em> Hope!</p>\n\n<p>With a gasp she awoke. The light stabbed at her eyes. The pain in her head was unbearable. She looked around, squinting. She was in some kind of basement. She saw stacks of old furniture, dusty, disused. A workbench, a fridge. Light came from a single yellowed bulb hanging on a chain.</p>\n\n<p>She was on a mattress, single, no sheets. the frame came up the side like a hospital bed.</p>\n\n<p>Her wrists were bound behind her. by the feel of it, her own handcuffs, looped through a hole in the frame.</p>\n\n<p>She tasted… Orange Juice? Somebody had been giving her fluids bit by bit while she was unconscious. She was still clothed. a good sign. perhaps they hadn&#39;t searched her as thoroughly as they should have. She&#39;d have to see if she got the chance.</p>\n\n<p>Suddenly she heard a door somewhere behind her open…</p>\n\n<p>~</p>\n\n<p>Emil had done his job, done as he was told. He&#39;d activated the package as the Alert had told him to, immediately after the gap in the phenomenon closed, he threw the switch. He heard the explosions, distant, a series… And then a splash. Dockside perhaps? Or a bridge? He didn&#39;t know. Wasn&#39;t his place.</p>\n\n<p>Blue 12 is hold but prepare all packages. Detonators, transmitters, balloons with sensor packages on rooftops. Those he&#39;d had to abandon, since he couldn&#39;t go outside. Red 4, detonate red Package 4, all other orders superseded.</p>\n\n<p><em>All other orders superseded.</em> He wondered if that meant his Blue 12 was the same as others… Were there others? He survived by chance. Could others have had other orders? He hadn&#39;t seen other messages in the alerts, but then, he was only a ∆6, no specialized comms, not even a government phone…</p>\n\n<p>But that was alright. Now he just had one priority, no means to follow any other orders. Just one thing to be concerned with: Sarya.</p>\n\n<p>Well, Sarya, and his prisoner.</p>\n\n<p>As he opened the door to the basement, he saw a bit of small movement from the mattress. Good, movement meant she was alive. </p>\n\n<p>After being out for two days, he&#39;d begun to worry the damage he&#39;d done was permanent.</p>\n\n<p>He saw a small glimmer from under the pile of furniture in the far corner… &quot;Good girl Sarya, stay hidden where I put you…&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Leaning up against the workbench, he looked at his prisoner. Blonde, fit, weathered, maybe 30, 33… Now that she was awake, he could see, she had hard eyes.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m glad to see you awake. I&#39;m sorry for having to hurt you, I&#39;m glad it wasn&#39;t too badly. I know you holstered your weapon when you saw my little girl, but I had no guarantee that wasn&#39;t a trick on your part. Are you thirsty? Hungry? I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t have much, well, more now, with your pack. I hope you don&#39;t mind I fed my daughter one of your MREs.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Sharon glared, she couldn&#39;t decide whether or not to trust him. He seemed innocent, but there was something to him she couldn&#39;t place, something he reminded her of. And nothing in her experience could make that a good thing.</p>"
