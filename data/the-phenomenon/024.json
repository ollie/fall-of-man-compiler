  "body": "<blockquote>\n<p><em>Oh Come</em> <strong><em>On!</em></strong> There&#39;s gotta be someone here!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The sound was beginning to get on Jesse&#39;s nerves. The constant clicking and rustling of the &quot;critters&quot; on the outside of the CDC was disconcerting. He expected them to be there, hell, he expected the building to be jumping. If there were going to be <em>anyone</em> left alive, anyone who had any idea what the hell these things were or how to get rid of &#39;em, it was gonna be <em>here.</em> But they weren&#39;t.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I can&#39;t <em>believe</em> this. I mean, it ain&#39;t dead. the building ain&#39;t chock full-o-corpses like all the other hospitals and shit..</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The weight of the IR goggles and the full body armor he wore kept him hot, sweating. The cloth underlayer was beginning to chafe the longer he wore everything.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>One more sweep, maybe we missed somethin&#39;.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As Jesse made his way from floor to floor, he kept a careful ear out for the sound of wind. The building was without power as far as he could tell, so there was no air conditioning, but a single broken window could mean a sudden and (he was betting) unpleasant death. As he came to the doorway from the stairwell to the next floor, he was hammered by the sudden smell.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I&#39;m starting to think this whole trip was a waste of time. We&#39;re gonna have to find a hotel or somethin&#39;, somewhere with an underground garage we can siphon gas out of parked cars to get home.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Is there.. Is there somebody there?</em></p>\n\n<p>The voice from the dark was frightened, desperate, and weak.</p>"
